# Headphones Website

This project is part of the `ALX HTML & CSS` curriculum. It involves creating a responsive landing page for a headphones brand based on a Figma design. The goal is to practice converting a visual mockup into a functional web page using `HTML5` and `CSS3`.

## Project Overview

The webpage replicates a Figma layout and demonstrates key front-end skills, including responsive design, hover interactions, and layout alignment. All content is centered and limited to a maximum width of `1000px`.

## Figma Design

You need to create an account on Figma and duplicate the provided design file into your drafts.
If you cannot access it, use the alternative Figma file link given in your project instructions.

### Required Fonts:

- Source Sans Pro

- Spin Cycle OT

### Features and Interactions

- Responsive layout that switches to the mobile version at screen width 480px or less.

- Links change color to `#FF6565` on hover or active.

- Buttons change opacity to `0.9` on hover or active.

Content is centered and constrained to a `max width of 1000px`.

### Learning Objectives

- Reproduce a professional design from Figma using `HTML` and `CSS`

- Apply semantic `HTML` structure

- Use Flexbox and media queries for responsiveness

- Implement hover and active effects

- Maintain clean, organized, and readable code

### Testing Responsiveness

Resize the browser window to 480px or less to verify the mobile layout.
Hover over links and buttons to check interaction effects.
